  DQXLauncher
</h1>

DQXLauncher is a simple, modern launcher for the Dragon Quest X MMORPG. It is built with WinUI 3 and supports the latest
version of Windows 10 and Windows 11. It is designed to be lightweight and launch quickly, and has the lofty goal to
eventually replace DQXConfig.exe, DQXLauncher.exe, DQXUpdater.exe, and [DQXClarity.exe][clarity] with a single
application which makes the game easy to play for anyone, anywhere.
