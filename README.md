# DQXLauncher

DQXLauncher is a simple, modern launcher for the Dragon Quest X MMORPG. It is built with WinUI 3 and supports the latest
version of Windows 10 and all of Windows 11. It is designed to be lightweight and launch quickly, and has the lofty goal
to eventually replace DQXConfig.exe, DQXLauncher.exe, DQXUpdater.exe, and DQXClarity.exe with a single application which
makes the game easy to play for anyone, anywhere.

## Current State
DQXLauncher is currently in extremely early, pre-alpha development and is not yet feature complete or stable. Use at
your own risk.
